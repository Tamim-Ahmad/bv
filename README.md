  git@github.com:magnet-cl/django-project-template.git`

Pull the code from the project template:

### Logging Database Entries

The project automatically generates logs for every user action that create, delete or
updates an apps models object. If a field of the object is updated, the log will store
the initial and the final state of the field. The log will ignore the update of the
many2many fields. If a model has a sensitive field for wich you don't want to display
the update information, you have to add it to LOG_SENSITIVE_FIELDS in settings. If you
want to ignore a field, you can add it to LOG_IGNORE_FIELDS in settings.

The project doesn't log any action made through automatic tasks.
## Deployment

Deployment is automated with Ansible, which is installed by quickstart. Add your servers to `ansible/inventory.yaml` and deploy with:
* `ansible/deploy.sh <host_name>`

After a successful deployment, you can update with:
* `ansible/update.sh <host_name>`

For more information and additional tasks, see `ansible/Readme.md`.

### Storing files on S3
